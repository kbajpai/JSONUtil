# JSONUtil
The JSONUtil project has two goals. The first is to provide JSON serialization and deserialization methods for CFMX 7 and other CFML engines which are compatible with ColdFusion's Serialize/DeserializeJSON functions. The second is to provide better mapping between CF/Java/SQL data types and JavaScript data types for JSON serialization on all CFML engines.
